# WHMCS-AutoReply

Automatically replies WHMCS tickets with a default message, especially to stall time on days when your management team is on vacation.

### Why this?

Save time for more important things and tickets to handle, tickets with repetitive keywords should be replied with an automatic reply to make the job less miserable.

### Installation

Extract the repository and copy the files within src/ to somewhere safe. You will need to fill in the credentials in "config.php" and set up a cronjob to cron.php that runs every 10 minutes.

### Contributing and to-dos

This should probably have an option to escalate tickets to people for tickets written in a specific language - pull requests are always welcome!
